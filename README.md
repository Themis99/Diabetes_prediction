# Diabetes_prediction
In this project we use the diabetes dataset in which we try to predict disease progression one year after baseline. This is a regression problem in which we're trying to predict a value.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by the Sklearn library used to develop the prediction algorithms. The dataset consists of 11 columns where 10 are the predictive variables and the eleventh is the target which is essentially a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html)
